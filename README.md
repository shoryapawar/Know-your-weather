# Know your Weather
### This application provides accurate and current weather information. Utilizing its built-in search filter, you can effortlessly retrieve weather forecasts for any city. The app intelligently suggests the closest city name based on your input, ensuring convenient and efficient use. Expect a comprehensive 7-day forecast and all the essential weather data you require. 

### For Weather Information 
#### I used [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### For City Names 
#### I used [GeoDB Cities Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)

### To use it in your System Clone it
#### then use command `npm i`

### I also used AsyncPaginate and React Accordion
#### also install them   `npm i react-accessible-accordion react-select-async-paginate`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
